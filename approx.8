.SH NAME
approx \- proxy server for Debian archive files

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B approx
[\fIOPTION\fP]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B approx
listens for HTTP requests made by
.BR apt\-get (8).
It maintains a cache of Debian archive files that have been previously
downloaded, so that it can respond with a local copy when possible.
If a file not in the cache is requested,
.B approx
will download it from a remote Debian repository and deliver the
contents to the client, simultaneously caching it for future use.

Over time, the
.B approx
server cache will grow to contain multiple, unneeded versions of
Debian packages.  The
.BR gc_approx (8)
program removes these from the cache.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-e ", " \-\^\-error
Messages are printed to standard error instead of the system log.
.TP
.BR \-f ", " \-\^\-foreground
The
.B approx
server runs in the foreground instead of detaching as a daemon.

.SH EXAMPLES
By default,
.B approx
listens on port 9999 (for compatibility with
.BR apt\-cache (8)).
Suppose that a client machine's
.I /etc/apt/sources.list
file contains the following lines:
.IP
deb     http://apt:9999/debian  testing main contrib
.br
deb     http://apt:9999/misc    testing main
.br
deb-src http://apt:9999/debian  unstable main contrib
.PP
In this example,
.I apt
is the hostname of the
.B approx
server machine on the local network.
Each distribution, such as "debian" or "misc", is mapped
to a remote repository in the
.B approx
server's configuration file.
.PP
For example, the
.I approx.conf
file on the
.B approx
server might contain the lines
.IP
debian  http://debian.mirrors.pair.com
.br
misc    ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat

.SH FILES
.TP
.I /etc/approx/approx.conf
.br
Configuration file for
.B approx
and
.BR gc_approx .
.TP
.I /var/cache/approx
.br
Cache directory for archive files.

.SH SEE ALSO
.IR approx.conf (5),
.BR gc_approx (8),
.BR apt\-get (8),
.IR sources.list (5)

.SH BUGS
.PP
When a client uses
.BR apt\-get (8)
to install a package that is not in the
.B approx
server's cache,
the transfer will occasionally fail with an MD5 checksum error.
In all of the cases the author has observed, the file has been cached
correctly on the server,
and re-running
.BR apt\-get (8)
solves the problem.
