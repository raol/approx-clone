Changing the location of the approx cache

  Move your cache where you want it, then
  replace the /var/cache/approx directory by a symlink:

      mv /var/cache/approx /somewhere
      ln -s /somewhere/approx /var/cache/approx

  You should use a subdirectory for the cache, not a top-level
  filesystem with a lost+found directory in it, to avoid complaints from
  the approx-gc program.

Exporting a local package repository

  This is supported with file URLs.  Note that the syntax for file URLs
  requires 3 leading slashes (two for the URL syntax, and one for the root
  of the pathname).  So you can add something like this to /etc/approx.conf:

      local   file:///my/local/repo

  The repo must have the structure that apt expects, including a
  Packages.gz index.  You can maintain a local repo with a tool like
  dpkg-scanpackages or reprepro.

Changing the TCP port on which approx listens

  Run "dpkg-reconfigure approx" and enter the desired port number
  when prompted.

Changing the IP addresses on which approx listens

  Add a host address specifier at the beginning of the approx entry
  in /etc/inetd.conf.  See the inetd(8) manual page for details.

Controlling access to approx using TCP wrappers (hosts.allow and hosts.deny)

  The /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny files can be used for
  host-based control of the approx service.

  After adding the appropriate entries (see the hosts_access(5) manual page),
  add the line
      OPTIONS="-l"
  to the file /etc/default/openbsd-inetd and then restart openbsd-inetd.

Making approx use a proxy for its downloads

  Since approx uses the curl(1) command to download files from
  remote repositories, you can use the http_proxy environment variable
  (or one of the others documented in the curl(1) manual page).

  To pass this to approx, modify the inetd.conf entry for approx to run
  an executable wrapper script instead of the /usr/sbin/approx binary.
  You can use something like this for the wrapper:

      #!/bin/sh

      export http_proxy=myproxy.org:1234
      exec /usr/sbin/approx
