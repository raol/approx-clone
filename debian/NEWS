approx (5.7-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  The approx-gc program has been removed.
  Cleanup of the approx cache is now done using a simple find(1)
  command that removes files older than a specified number of days.

approx (5.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The $interval parameter is back, and approx once again caches
  Release files for up to $interval minutes. "File not found"
  responses are also cached now (in the form of empty files with
  zero permissions).

  The approx-update program is no longer necessary and has been removed.

  Application of pdiffs is now done in the background so clients
  do not have to wait for it.

approx (4.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The configuration file for approx can now be specified on the command line
  (i.e., the /etc/inetd.conf entry) using the "-c" or "--config" option.

  The pathname of the cache directory can now be specified in the
  configuration file using the $cache parameter.

approx (4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The approx program no longer runs as an independent daemon;
  it is now run by inetd.  Since the listening port and addresses
  can be specified in /etc/inetd.conf, the $port and $interface
  configuration parameters have been removed.  Host access control
  using /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny is also supported by inetd.

approx (3.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  A new program, approx-import, has been added. It can be used to populate
  the approx cache with existing .deb files, such as those found in
  /var/cache/apt/archives.

  For consistency, the other auxiliary programs have been renamed to
  approx-gc and approx-update.

approx (3.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  If both IPv4 and IPv6 sockets are supported, approx will listen on both.

 -- Eric Cooper <ecc@cmu.edu>  Wed, 16 Apr 2008 21:49:01 -0400

approx (3.1.0~rc1) experimental; urgency=low

  TCP wrappers support has been added. Access control rules can be specified
  for the approx daemon in /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny.

  Approx now listens on an IPv6 socket if supported by the kernel, otherwise
  it falls back to IPv4.  The $interface parameter is not supported for IPv6,
  but TCP wrappers or iptables rules can be used instead.

  A new configuration parameter, $max_redirects, specifies the maximum number
  of HTTP redirections that will be followed when downloading a remote file.

  Requests for directories are now passed through without caching, so that
  tools like "wget -r" can be used to mirror a repository known to approx.
  Directory requests are detected by a path with a trailing / (or an HTTP
  redirection to one).

approx (3.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  The approx server now handles pdiffs: incremental diffs to Packages files.
  When a client downloads a pdiff, the approx server uses it to update
  the cached Packages file if possible.  When an up-to-date Packages file
  is present in the cache, the client's DiffIndex request is denied,
  forcing the client to fall back to the full Packages file.

  A new configuration parameter, $pdiffs, controls this behavior.
  Setting it to false causes approx to deny all DiffIndex requests,
  as it did previously.

  Since approx must decompress and recompress Packages files when applying
  pdiffs, and gzip is significantly faster than bzip2, approx denies requests
  for .bz2 versions and only delivers .gz versions.

  The $interval parameter has been eliminated. Now the approx server
  always contacts the remote repository when a Release or Release.gpg file
  is requested, and all other index files in the cache are validated
  against the Release file.

  A new configuration parameter, $offline, causes the approx server
  to deliver (possibly out-of-date) cached files when they cannot be
  downloaded from remote repositories.

approx (2.9.0) unstable; urgency=low

  Configuration parameters in /etc/approx/approx.conf should now begin
  with '$' to distinguish them from repository names. The old style is
  still accepted with a warning message.

  Several parameters have been added: $user, $group, $syslog, $verbose.
  See the approx.conf man page for details.

  The gc_approx program now removes empty subdirectories from the cache,
  simplifying the weekly cron job.

approx (2.06) unstable; urgency=low

  A new configuration variable, interface, forces approx to listen for
  connections on a specific network interface only.

  The approx server can now listen on privileged ports such as port 80.

  File: URIs are now supported in the approx.conf file.

approx (2.00) unstable; urgency=low

  Approx now uses curl subprocesses to download files from remote
  repositories.

 -- Eric Cooper <ecc@cmu.edu>  Mon, 10 Oct 2005 10:04:09 -0400

approx (1.16) unstable; urgency=low

  The approx server now forks multiple processes to handle concurrent
  requests. A new configuration variable, max_wait, can be used to
  specify how many seconds an approx process will wait for a concurrent
  download of a file to complete, before attempting to download the file
  itself.

 -- Eric Cooper <ecc@cmu.edu>  Fri, 13 May 2005 12:23:37 -0400

approx (1.14) unstable; urgency=low

  The --foreground option allows approx to be run more easily from
  the command line, a debugger, or the runit init scheme.

 -- Eric Cooper <ecc@cmu.edu>  Thu,  5 May 2005 10:43:36 -0400

approx (1.13) unstable; urgency=low

  The approx daemon always uses /var/cache/approx now;
  the cache directory can no longer be changed in the approx.conf file.
  But /var/cache/approx can be a symbolic link, so the cache directory
  can still be located elsewhere.
