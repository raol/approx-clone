approx (2.9.0) unstable; urgency=low

Configuration parameters in /etc/approx/approx.conf should now begin
with '$' to distinguish them from repository names.  The old style is
still accepted with a warning message.

Several parameters have been added: $user, $group, $syslog, $verbose.
See the approx.conf man page for details.

approx (2.06) unstable; urgency=low

A new configuration variable, interface, forces approx to listen for
connections on a specific network interface only.

The approx server can now listen on privileged ports such as port 80.

File: URIs are now supported in the approx.conf file.

approx (2.00) unstable; urgency=low

Approx now uses curl subprocesses to download files from remote
repositories.

approx (1.16) unstable; urgency=low

The approx server now forks multiple processes to handle concurrent
requests.  A new configuration variable, max_wait, can be used to
specify how many seconds an approx process will wait for a concurrent
download of a file to complete, before attempting to download the file
itself.

approx (1.14) unstable; urgency=low

The --foreground option allows approx to be run more easily from
the command line, a debugger, or the runit init scheme.

approx (1.13) unstable; urgency=low

The approx daemon always uses /var/cache/approx now;
the cache directory can no longer be changed in the approx.conf file.
But /var/cache/approx can be a symbolic link, so the cache directory
can still be located elsewhere.
