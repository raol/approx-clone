approx (2.00) unstable; urgency=low

The approx server now forks multiple processes to handle concurrent
requests.  A new configuration variable, max_wait, can be used to
specify how many seconds an approx process will wait for a concurrent
download of a file to complete, before attempting to download the file
itself.

approx (1.14) unstable; urgency=low

The --foreground option allows approx to be run more easily from
the command line, a debugger, or the runit init scheme.

approx (1.13) unstable; urgency=low

The approx daemon always uses /var/cache/approx now;
the cache directory can no longer be changed in the approx.conf file.
But /var/cache/approx can be a symbolic link, so the cache directory
can still be located elsewhere.
