approx (3.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  The approx server now handles pdiffs: incremental diffs to Packages files.
  When a client downloads a pdiff, the approx server uses it to update
  the cached Packages file if possible.  When an up-to-date Packages file
  is present in the cache, the client's DiffIndex request is denied,
  forcing the client to fall back to the full Packages file.

  A new configuration parameter, $pdiffs, controls this behavior.
  Setting it to false causes approx to deny all DiffIndex requests,
  as it did previously.

  Since approx must decompress and recompress Packages files when applying
  pdiffs, and gzip is significantly faster than bzip2, approx denies requests
  for .bz2 versions and only delivers .gz versions.

  The $interval parameter has been eliminated. Now the approx server
  always contacts the remote repository when a Release or Release.gpg file
  is requested, and all other index files in the cache are validated
  against the Release file.

approx (2.9.0) unstable; urgency=low

  Configuration parameters in /etc/approx/approx.conf should now begin
  with '$' to distinguish them from repository names. The old style is
  still accepted with a warning message.

  Several parameters have been added: $user, $group, $syslog, $verbose.
  See the approx.conf man page for details.

  The gc_approx program now removes empty subdirectories from the cache,
  simplifying the weekly cron job.

approx (2.06) unstable; urgency=low

  A new configuration variable, interface, forces approx to listen for
  connections on a specific network interface only.

  The approx server can now listen on privileged ports such as port 80.

  File: URIs are now supported in the approx.conf file.

approx (2.00) unstable; urgency=low

  Approx now uses curl subprocesses to download files from remote
  repositories.

approx (1.16) unstable; urgency=low

  The approx server now forks multiple processes to handle concurrent
  requests. A new configuration variable, max_wait, can be used to
  specify how many seconds an approx process will wait for a concurrent
  download of a file to complete, before attempting to download the file
  itself.

approx (1.14) unstable; urgency=low

  The --foreground option allows approx to be run more easily from
  the command line, a debugger, or the runit init scheme.

approx (1.13) unstable; urgency=low

  The approx daemon always uses /var/cache/approx now;
  the cache directory can no longer be changed in the approx.conf file.
  But /var/cache/approx can be a symbolic link, so the cache directory
  can still be located elsewhere.
